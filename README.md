## 📃 Description:
**Book Loom** is a web application designed to foster a sense of community among readers by facilitating the sharing of books. It allows users to easily lend, borrow, and keep track of books within their community. Each book entry includes detailed information such as the title, author, synopsis, and current owner. The platform serves as a digital bridge connecting book owners with potential readers, ensuring that beloved books are circulated and enjoyed rather than gathering dust on shelves. By promoting reading and making a wide range of books accessible to everyone, Book Loom weaves together the interests and collections of individual readers into a vibrant, interconnected community - much like how a loom intertwines to create a cohesive and beautiful tapestry of shared knowledge and stories.

**Features:**

    📌 Centralized Book Management: Users can manage their personal library, listing books they own and those they are willing to lend.
    📌 Lending and Borrowing System: Track who currently has a book and the status of borrowed books.
    📌 Detailed Book Information: Each book entry includes the title, author, synopsis, and current owner.
    📌 Library Exploration: Browse a comprehensive library of available books within the community.
    📌 Search and Filter: Efficient search and filter options to find specific books quickly.
    📌 User Profiles: Profiles for users to manage their book lists and view their lending/borrowing history.
    📌 Comment Posting: Share thoughts, reviews, and recommendations on each book.
